# FurEliseVisualisation
This is a simple prototype for drawing shapes based on music notes, in this case the program (written in c++ with cinder framework) takes the midi notes from the piano and simply makes a flower if the note is on the treble clef, or destroys a flower if the note is on the bass clef, flowers motion is random based on OpenSimplex noise. The scene is built in real time, not post processing
Note: cinder libs are not part of this repo, can be downloaded separately and linked to the project.

the end result looks like this:
